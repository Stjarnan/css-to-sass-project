# Info

This project was created as part of a [Techdegree](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree), as such it was created when I was still learning. I can find many mistakes and things I could and should have done better. But out of pure nostalgia I want to keep this project here to look back at down the road and reminisce. I basically just want to be sure that I do not lose it.
